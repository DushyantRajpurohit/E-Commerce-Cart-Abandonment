# 🛒 E-Commerce Cart Abandonment Dashboard & ML Analysis

This project presents an interactive dashboard and machine learning model to analyze and predict **cart abandonment behavior** in an e-commerce setting. It helps businesses understand **why users abandon carts**, identify key patterns, and take **proactive steps** like targeted offers to improve conversion rates.

---

## Project Objectives

- Analyze user session behavior and identify abandonment trends.
- Visualize key metrics such as cart value, demographics, and device preferences.
- Build a basic machine learning model to predict the likelihood of cart abandonment.
- Suggest data-driven strategies to reduce cart abandonment.

---

## Key Insights

- **Accessories** have a high abandonment rate — potential opportunity for discount nudges.
- **Mobile users** tend to abandon carts more often, likely due to poor UX or payment issues.
- A large share of users are **female**, which can guide product-based campaigns.
- **Social media referrals** have lower purchase intent — consider targeted remarketing.
- **Virginia** sees the highest abandonment; **New York** the least — useful for regional targeting.
- **No Guest Checkout** is the top reason for abandonment — a clear UX fix opportunity.
